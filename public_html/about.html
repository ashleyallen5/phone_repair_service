            have a website or anything of that matter because we were first locally set in place here in Indianola. Now
            that we are competing with other local stores, our profits had led us to work continuously throughout these years.</b></p>

            the store with my mom to pay out of pocket which was a hefty fee. My younger entrepreneurial mind was fed up with having 
            to go and pay every time my phone broke so I decided to just do it myself. The parts were easy to find online and the 
            instructions to do so were so very simple.</b>

            it and branched out to students in school and then started a little business out of my dorm room. Once I saw that there was something 
            to do with this to make money, I branched out to some friends and crowd-sourced the money to open up my little shop.</b>

            and I know that we will succeed and hopefully make it into the international market. To keep updated with us
